This airline dataset includes 31,746,841 flights from 2015-2019 and joins in available data on location and time-specific weather. We have defined our binary classification task as no delay (=0) versus delay, diverted or cancelled flights (=1), where we applied the national standard definition of delay which is greater than 15 minutes delay to the arrival of the flight. This kind of analysis could prove useful to both travellers and airline companies as an early detection system that customer travel plans may be disrupted, so that alternative plans can be put into place sooner. We aim to build a model that was widely applicable as possible instead of narrowly focusing on specific airports, airlines or specific flight outcomes (i.e. ignoring cancelled or diverted flights). This represents an unbalanced classification task given the rarity of the \"positive\" outcome (defined as delayed, diverted or cancelled in this instance, and subsequently referred to just as \"delayed flights\") which represents roughly 20% of the flights in our dataset. \n\n###1.2 Testing approach and Evaluation Metrics\n\nGiven the time series nature of the study, we chose to reserve the older data from 2015-2018 for our training set and to utilise the most recent data from 2019 for dev and test sets. We randomly sampled 50% of the 2019 data for our dev set and the remaining 50% formed our test set which we have reserved for only the final fine-tuned model predictions. A balanced sampling approach was utilised so we maintained the sampe proportions of our minority/majority class labaels in each datset. We considered it important that our unseen test data should not be sampled from the same dates that our training data comes from, given that the evidence that a model is practically useful depends on its ability to predict delays on future flights.  \n\nA review of the literature on airport delay prediction studies suggest that accuracy is the most frequently reported metric but we believe that this is not sufficient since it puts greater weight on correct predictions within the majority class (in this case \"no delays\" which represents 80% of the data) (Etani 2019, Patgiri 2020). We believe that recall is the key metric in this analysis given the opportunity to action on correct predictions regarding delayed flights. However, since precision is also important, given the risk of unnecessary preemptive investment into alternative travel arrangements would cause great frustration to customers, we would argue that the composite measure of F1-score should be our secondary target evaluation metric for optimization, following our primary target of recall optimization. To be practically useful, we believe (based on our collective subjective view and a review of the literature) that recall should be at least .8, meaning that at least 80% of all delayed flights are correctly predicted and precision should be at least .8, meaning that no more than 20% of predicted delays are actually on time. This would mean we are targeting an F1-score of 0.8.\n\n###1.3 Baseline and Modelling Approach\n\nFor our baseline, we selected the naive classifier based on a simple logistic regression model which produces the crude prediction of \"No Delay\" for every flight. Given the unbalanced classification task, this still represents a reasonably strong accuracy of 80% and therefore underlines again the reason that accuracy cannot be the sole metric of interest. This baseline produces a zero value for precision and for recall.  For our algorithms of interest, we will explore optimizations of logistic regression as well as various formulations of decision trees.\n\n###1.4 Study Limitations\n\nIntuitively, weather will be a critical component to predicting likelihood of a flight delay, however real weather patterns at the time of flight are not available ahead of the flight time when the flight delay predictions would be most useful, e.g. at least several hours ahead of the flight departure. This highlights a disconnect between the data we have available and the reality of this use case. For a machine learning model to be practically useful, it would need to rely on weather _forecasts_ rather than on realized weather patterns. How different weather forecasts are from realized weather patterns will inform how well our training data will support accurate flight delay prediction, though this is not something that can be evaluated through our unseen test data (which again utilises actual realised weather).\n\nAdditionally, in the real world, a system for predicting delays would rely on a real-time system taking into account delays at connected airports where the relevant aircraft may be transiting through. This real-time system may also take into account evolving weather patterns over the flight paths of the relevant aircraft. These would involve utilising dynamic graph algorithms since the flight paths planned on a specific day may different significantly from the flight path planned the prior week or indeed the prior year. Therefore our traditional approach to training set / test set evaluation would not work in this situation. \n\nAnother limitation is that for our base model we selected the simple binary task of predicting delay or no delay. However, a more meaningful outcome may require more granular classes such as 'no delay', 'modest delay', 'severe delay' given that different plans may be required in the case of a 1 hour delay compared to a 3 hours delay and additionally knowing the probability of having cancelled or diverted flight outcome would be important for customers. We believe that a two stage approach similar to that identified in the literature (Thiagarajan 2017), where we first predict delay or no delay (as we are doing in this analysis), and then for delayed flights we further predict duration of delay would be appropriate. Due to time constraints we focused just on the first stage of this model."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#2.

In many instances, a delayed departure can be counteracted by \"making up time\" in the air, in which case the travellers still reach their destination on time. Departure delay was therefore considered less important than an arrival delay. Our EDA showed a classic skewed curve for total minues of delay. For our classification task, we focused on delays of 15 minutes or more and also included cancelled and diverted flights in the definition of our positive outcome. We considered it important to consider all three types of detrimental flight outcomes in our model because they all occur in the real world, and consequently our model trained on this data should be able to correctly identify all of these real life events. \n\nGiven that the positive outcome is underepresented, this has potential significance for our algorithms of interest.

In other words, previously delayed flights contribute to the delays in subsequent flights. To that end, this could be a reason why flights arriving later in the day experiecne higher delays.

We want to ensure that multi-collinarity doesn't impact our Logistic Regression model, so we did some exploratory runs comparing our metrics for data with weather, data without any weather and data without TEMP.

Details of our collaborative effort to determine which features to include/exclude are provided in [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O-BqLHvE9cyPvAKEmtWlk9OBhoGCAhXaeJuuIPRCI3o/edit?)\n\nFrom the original 2 datasets, this involved the following:\n- Airlines dataset: we removed variables that provided \n  - Duplicative information (i.e. different encodings for the airport station, city, and time variables such as quarter given that we were already including month), \n  - Variables that were linked too closely to the outcome (i.e. taxi in, taxi out time, and all the delay status variables) and finally \n  - Variables that based on our EDA and our intuition did not appear to be a meaningful predictor of delays (i.e. day of month, US State of origin or destination airport)\n- Weather dataset:\n  - See [separate notebook for joining weather to airlines](https://dbc-b1c912e7-d804.cloud.databricks.com/?o=7564214546094626#notebook/1652976813635466/command/1652976813635476)\n  - Given a large number of potential variables that all described a certain kind of weather event (i.e. wind, precipitation, or visibility), for simplicity we utilised only the available continuous variables and ignored all potential categorical variables\n  - We also simplified the available continuous variables by taking a daily average of their output. While we know this means that we applied 'future weather' to predict delays to flights, we justified this on the basis that the real-world use case would use weather forecasts to support predictions and used this future weather as a proxy for these weather forecasts (see Section 1.5 for a more details discussion of this study limitation)\n  \n  <img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/blob/master/join_weather.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\" >\n  \n- Creating new features:\n  - We created a directed graph of all the flights in the training set and used this to calculate the pagerank of each of the stations, with the hypothesis that the importance of a airport station may be associated with its likelihood of delayed flights. We therefore created 2 new variables for both the origin airport pagerank and the destination airport pagerank. Additional centrality measures were also considered (betweenness and closeness) but due to high correlation between these and pagerank, we chose to focus on just pagerank.\n  \n###3.2 Complete list of features included\n\nThe below is the exhaustive list of features which were included in all algorithms. Most features are self-explanatory, where they are not self-explanatory, a brief description follows. Additionally, all features were numeric with the exception of some which are noted as categorical. \n\n- Airport Station Characteristics \n  - ORIGIN (Origin airport code - categorical), DEST (Destination airport code - categorical), DEST_LATITUDE, DEST_LONGITUDE, DEST_ELEV, ORIGIN_LATITUDE, ORIGIN_LONGITUDE, ORIGIN_ELEV\n- Flight-specific features\n  - OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER (Flight company code - categorial), CRS_ELAPSED_TIME (expected duration of flight)\n- Time-specific features\n  - YEAR (categorial), MONTH (categorial), DAY_OF_MONTH (categorical), DAY_OF_WEEK (categorical), CRS_DEP_TIME (time of departure in minutes)\n- Graph-related (airport importance) features\n  - DEST_PAGERANK, ORIGIN_PAGERANK\n- Daily average Weather\n  - ORIGIN_WND_ANGLE_AVG / DEST_WND_ANGLE_AVG (observed wind speed rate in meters per second), \n  - ORIGIN_WND_SPEED_AVG /  DEST_WND_ANGLE_AVG (observed wind speed rate in meters per second), \n  - ORIGIN_CIG_AVG / DEST_CIG_AVG (ceiling height in meters), \n  - ORIGIN_VIS_AVG / DEST_VIS_AVG (visibility distance in meters), \n  - ORIGIN_TMP_AVG / DEST_TMP_AVG (air temperature in Celsius, factors of 10), \n  - ORIGIN_DEW_AVG / DEST_DEW_AVG (dew point temperature in Celsius, factors of 10),  \n  - ORIGIN_SLP_AVG / DEST_SLP_AVG (sea level pressure in Hectopascals, factor by 10), \n  - ORIGIN_PRECIP_RATE_AVG / DEST_PRECIP_RATE_AVG (depth of liquid precipitation at time of observation, in millimeters),\n  - ORIGIN_SNOW_DEPTH_AVG / DEST_SNOW_DEPTH_AVG (snow depth in millimeters)\n\nAdditionally, for our tree-based models, we were able to incorporate additional features that were highly correlated with some of the features above. This is because tree-based models are not limited by multicollinearity concerns, so by including these features we can potentially identify the best potential predictor features. Additionally, categorical features were transformed to ordinal features using Brieman's methods and are noted accordingly below (as above, all other features are continuous).  \n\n- Airport Station Characteristics\n  - ORIGIN STATE FIPS / DEST STATE FIPS (US State identifier - Ordinal)\n  - ORIGIN CITY MARKET ID / DEST CITY MARKET ID (US City identifier - Ordinal)\n- Flight-specific features\n  - CRS_ARR_TIME\n  - DISTANCE\n- Time-specific features\n  - QUARTER, CRS_ARR_TIME (expected arrival time)\n  \n###3.3 Missing values treatment and Encoding process\n\n- Missing values. We spent considerable effort recovering all of the weather stations (except for one ambiguous airport in North Dakota) and we selected only those weather fields that were core, mandatory fields from the weather data collection.  In addition, we included one optional weather field, the snow depth, since it was approximately 75% non-null. (We set the value to zero for the 25% missing snow depth entries.)  The query provided below **(see 3.3.1)**, shows the percent of missing data for each feature.  Outside of snow depth, other features were present in **99.5%** of the observations, so we choose to skip those rows (handleInvalid=\"skip\" in data encoding pipeline) with missing values. This resulted in minimal dropout from 31,746,841 observations down to 30,999,177\n observations (2.3% dropout).\n\n- Treatment of categorical variables (one hot encoding). For logistic regression, we one-hot encoded several categorical features.  However, for decision trees algorithms (including Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees), we created a separate data encoding pipeline, treating ordered categorical features (e.g. DAY_OF_WEEK, QUARTER, DAY_OF_MONTH) as numerical and converting unordered categorical features (e.g. origin and destination airports and states, airlines carrier id, etc) to ordinals using Brieman's method.\n\n- Standardization. For the logistic regression data encoding pipeline, all numeric features were standardized.  This is necessary given that some features in terms of their mean and standard deviation vary wildly from other features depending on how they were measured.  For example, wind speed rate (WND) ranges from 0 to 80 meters per second where as ceiling height (CIG), measured in meters, ranges from 0 to 20,000. Without standardization, gradient descent would likely suffer from non-convergence given that the highest magnitude of values will distort the direction of the gradient.  Also, for L1 and L2 regularization, standardization is critical; otherwise regularization will tend to penalize those features in smaller scales.\n\n- Two Data Encoding Pipelines.  Decision trees don't require standardization of numeric values and can handle missing data. Also, given that one-hot encoding removes important signal related to the categorical features makes it unlikely that such features will be considered at a top level node, we decided to create a different data encoding pipeline for decision trees that would forgo standardization, treat ordinal categorical features as numeric, and convert unordered categorical features to ordinals using Brieman's method."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#\n# Create the binary outcome variable\n#\ndata_raw = airlines_and_weather.withColumn('OUTCOME', f.when((f.col(\"ARR_DELAY_NEW\") >

Algorithm Exploration\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/blob/master/algo_explore1.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\" >\n\nFor our analysis, we selected 2 traditional classification algorithms, specifically logistic regression and decision trees, with the intention to further consider various regularization options for logistic regression and bagging, boosting and random forest options for decision trees. Due to the fact that logistic regression is not suitable in the case of multicollinearity, our EDA efforts noted above were specifically designed to ensure the data pipeline informing our logistic regression model removed features which were highly correlated. We also ensured that our continuous features were normalized with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 so that gradient descent process would be optimized. \n\nFor our decision tree-based models, we were able to incorporate more features without concern about multicollinearity and generally include all features with limited preprocessing (no normalization or one-hot encoding of categorical features). Our expectation is that ensemble decision tree methods (specifically bagging with random forest and bagging with gradient-boosted trees) would produce the strongest results, as these models train on the most data, use balanced training sets, handle missing values more easily, and balance the bias-variance tradeoff through ensembles. In terms of computational cost (or time required), logistic regression and decision trees should be the most performant."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###4.1 Logistic Regression\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/blob/master/lr.png?raw=true\" align=\"left\" width=\"10%\" >\n\n\nFor logistic regression, we first started with a simple model trained on the full dataset.

implements a logic similar to that of random forests, but it operates on the rows (data observations) instead of the columns (features). It's underlying principle is to build complex, high variance trees (that individually might be overfit) and then overcome the high variance by averaging. We developed the bagging framework as a way to continue to train on balanced training sets, but be able to take advantage of all of our training data. We implemented bagging for decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosted trees. These models were expensive to train, so we implemented a human-based gridsearch whereby we split the different parameter settings we wanted to run between our four team members and had us each train different models. Depending on the performance of the databricks cluster at runtime, these models took up to ten hours to train. (We incorporated interim print statements to help us keep track of model training progress.)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# This is a set of helper functions that are used in

summarize these in the table below. This was a helpful exercise to help us build intuition into which were the most relevant features - and in particular which features were consistently relevant across different algorithm types. We see that departure time, month of flight, and airline carrier code are consistently important features, whereas other features expected to be consistently important such as rainfall and visibility, are not consistently top ranking features across these algorithm types. \n\nAs we examined feature importance for the different models, it was interesting to note how the ordered list of features changed from model to model. As an example, the departure time of day was the most influential feature for decison tree, random forest, and gradient boosted tree examples shown, but the fifth most important for logistic regression. Similarly, the rate of precipitation at the origin ranged from 18th (gradient boosted tree) to second (decision tree). These results were puzzling given how similarly the different models performed.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/leebean337/w261_images/blob/master/feature_importance.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\" >"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###4.4 Final Algorithm: Logistic Regression Theory and Toy Example\n\nDespite considerable effort dedicated to our tree-based modelling approaches, we ultimately selected logistic regression for our final algorithm given that it provided the best performance, both in term of f1-score and recall as well as runtime. In our case, there was little trade-off required in this decision. This section provides more background on the theory behind logistic regression, the gradient descent algorithm by which it is applied and a toy example outlining the steps involved in one iteration of gradient descent.\n\nLogistic regression is similar to linear regression in as far as it begins by fitting a linear relationship between the features and the outcome variable by determining the optimal weights associated with each feature. The key difference is that the outcome variable is binary and the resulting prediction from a logistic regression model must therefore be a binary classification as well. In terms of interpretation, a unit change in a feature will multiply the odds of the outcome variables by a constant factor (the associated weight). This technique relies on the use of a sigmoid function (g(z)) which translates the raw output of the linear regression (z) into a probability value between 0 and 1. This results in the predicted probability (hΘ(x)) that a particular example belongs to a specific class (usually the positive class).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/raw/master/LR%20sigmoid.jpg?raw=true\"/>\n\nUsing the toy example below, we will demonstrate how our algorithm will apply logistic regression using standard gradient descent. Our goal is to find the optimal parameters (Θ), which will minimize our logistic loss function J(Θ) where m is the number of training examples and for each training example, the true value of y determines whether the log of the predicted probability (log(hΘ(x))) or log of one minus the predicted probability (log(1-(hΘ(x))) will factor into the total loss calculation.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/raw/master/LR%20cost%20function.jpg?raw=true\"/>\n\nGradient descent is an iterative optimisation technique to find the minimum of the loss function, by taking steps down the gradient of the function until a set of parameters (Θ) which are sufficiently close to the minimum of the loss are identified. To determine the gradient step, we take the derivative of the loss function \\\\( \\nabla\\_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/raw/master/LR%20gradient%20calculation.jpg?raw=true\"/>\n\nThis array is then multiplied by the learning rate and then subtracted from the prior set of parameters (Θ) and the process is repeated again. This is continued until Θ_old and Θ_new are sufficiently close to one another that it doesn’t make sense to continue updating. \n\n\\\\(  \\theta\\_{\\text{new}} = \\theta\\_{\\text{old}} - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla\\_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\)\n\nThe below presents a toy example illustrating how an iteration of the algorithm would operate in practice. Five examples are provided in this toy training set with three features, two continuous variables representing the total amount of rainfall on the day of the flight and average visibility on the day of the flight (both normalized to values between 0 and 1) and a dummy variable representing time of flight (=1 for PM, =0 for AM). As in our dataset, a label = 1 means a delayed flight and a label = 0 means an ontime flight.\n\n| \\\\(i\\\\) | \\\\(x\\_{1i}\\\\) |    \\\\(x\\_{2i}\\\\)  |    \\\\(x\\_{3i}\\\\)  |   \\\\(y\\_i\\\\) | \n|:---:|:--------:|:---------------:|\n|  -  | PM |  Rain  | Visibility | label |  \n| 1     |1     |     0.0     |     1     |     0     |       \n| 2     |0     |     0.0     |     0.9     |     0     |       \n| 3     |1     |     0.1     |     0.5     |     1     |      \n| 4     |0     |     0.1     |     1     |     0     |     \n| 5     |1     |     1.0     |     0.2     |     1     |       \n\nThe parameter vector \\\\(\\theta\\\\) for our initial line \\\\(y=x \\\\) is  \\\\(\\theta\\\\) = \\\\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \\quad 1 \\ \\quad 1 \\ \\quad 0 \\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\) where the last value is the constant. \n         \nThe (augmented) data points \\\\(x_j\\\\) are:\n\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ .9 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ .1 \\\\\\ .5 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ .1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ .2 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\)\n\nThe following table provides the values required to calculate the loss as well as the gradient update required in the first iteration of gradient descent. \n\n| \\\\(i\\\\) |  \\\\(x\\_j'\\\\)  | \\\\(y\\_j\\\\) |   \\\\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\_j\\\\) | \\\\(h_ \\theta (x) = g(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\_j\\\\)) | <img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/raw/master//LR%20individual%20loss.jpg?raw=true\" width=60%/> | <img src=\"https://github.com/tonydisera/261-final-project-images/raw/master/LR%20individual%20gradient.jpg?raw=true\" width=60%/> |\n|:----:|:-----:|:----------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n|  -  |  input   | true \\\\(y\\\\)   |   linear weights    |  predicted probability       |loss  component for \\\\(x\\_j\\\\)       |gradient  component for \\\\(x\\_j\\\\)       \n| 1     | \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |  0   |     2.0             |    0.1192    |    0.1269    |\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 0.12 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 0.12 \\\\\\ 0.12 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |      \n| 2     | \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ .9 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |  0   |     0.9             |    0.2891  |    0.3412    |\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 0.26 \\\\\\ 0.29 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |   \n| 3     | \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ .1 \\\\\\ .5 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |  1   |     1.6             |   0.1680  |    1.7839    |\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} -0.83 \\\\\\ -0.08 \\\\\\ -0.42 \\\\\\ -0.83 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |   \n| 4     | \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ .1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |  0   |     1.1             |    0.2497  |    0.2873    |\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0.02 \\\\\\ 0.25 \\\\\\ 0.25 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |   \n| 5     | \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ .2 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   |  1   |     2.2             |    0.0998  |    2.3051    |\\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} -0.90 \\\\\\ -0.90 \\\\\\ -0.18 \\\\\\ -0.90 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)   | \n\n\nThe training loss \\\\(f(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\\\) for this data and these weights is: 0.1269 + 0.3412 + 1.7839 + 0.2873 +  2.3051 = 4.8444 / 5 = 0.96888\n\nOur gradient update is \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1.61 \\\\\\ -0.96 \\\\\\ 0.03 \\\\\\ -1.07 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\) and assuming a learning rate of \\\\(\\eta = \\\\)  0.1, we would adjust our initial weight matrix by \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} -0.16 \\\\\\ -0.10 \\\\\\ 0.003 \\\\\\ -0.11 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\)\n\nOur new weight matrix would therefore be \\\\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1.16 \\\\\\ 1.10 \\\\\\ 1.00 \\\\\\ 0.11 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\)\n\nThis process would continue until the the difference between the new weight matrix and the prior weight matrix becomes sufficiently small (i.e. where the derivative reaches nearly zero) that we can assume the minimum of the loss is reached and the optimal weight matrix has been approximated. The application of logistic regression in Spark MLlib differs from standard gradient descent which was applied above, since it would be extremely computational expensive to perform these calculations on our entire training set. Therefore, in practice stochastic gradient descent is applied. In this case only some of the examples, rather than the entire training set, are used to calculate the gradient that informs each step change."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#5.

And finally, results from each model will be collected to give overall model metrics.  \n  \nWe tried several variants of ensemble models e.g.\n- Season based : 4 models --> 'WINTER', 'SPRING', 'SUMMER', 'FALL'  \n- Time based: 3 models --> 'LATE_NIGHT', 'MORNING', 'EVENING'  \n- Season + Time based: 12 models --> 'WINTER-LATE_NIGHT', 'WINTER-MORNING', 'WINTER-EVENING', 'SPRING-LATE_NIGHT', 'SPRING-MORNING', 'SPRING-EVENING', 'SUMMER-LATE_NIGHT', 'SUMMER-MORNING', 'SUMMER-EVENING', 'FALL-LATE_NIGHT', 'FALL-MORNING', 'FALL-EVENING'  \n\nIn the interest of brevity, we have only provided code (output) for the final ensemble model [ Season + Time based: 12 models] as shown in the figure below.  \nThis model provided better results than ensemble models of just Seasons or just Time-of-day and of course, all the previous models shown above.  \n  \nFrom a scalability perspective, we believe that the parallel nature of Spark's machine learing API (ML Lib) works very well for such large datasets. The models train fairly quickly, with the ensemble only taking a few minutes. This is despite the fact that while the underlying MLLib data processing engine is distributed in nature, in our current implemenation, we train and evaluate the individual models themselves in series. Given more time, we would have liked to use the Spark framework to further parallelize the training and evaluation of the individual models as well."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 5.3.1 Add Season and Arrival Time of Day column to datasets"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Add relevant columns to

Conclusions"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In conclusion, our models are able to correctly predict (true positive) a negative arrival experience (including delayed arrivals >15 minutes, diverted or cancelled flights) with a recall of .67 and an f1-score of .42. This result holds for all flights across the United States, from the busiest airports to the smallest. Our model struggles the most with over-predicting delays, which is apparent in the relatively poor precision scores. We continue to believe that customers are most interested in correctly predicting when a flight might be delayed, and would react to our error in precision as \"getting lucky\", much the way one might feel when rain is predicted but never materializes. While there are clearly examples in the literature that perform better, closer inspection frequently reveals that those problem sets have been more finely specified by only focusing on select cities or select airlines. Moreover, performance comparison between models and confusion matrix for the final ensemble model are shown in the sections below.\n\nIn terms of machine learning items, some of our team's most significant learnings include:\n- The tuning decision we made that had the largest impact across all models was creating a balanced training set.\n- The process of writing the bagging algorithm from scratch really helped us understand how it worked.\n- We seemed to get \"stuck\" in a relatively narrow performance range with all of our tree-based models. Spark's MLLib API is relatively limited, and by the time we got our bagging algorithm working we had limited time to troubleshoot this. Given more time, we could have pulled a sample of the data out of Spark and experimented with the more versatile tools in SKLearn and then applied that knowledge to the larger dataset. Additionally, we could have explored our feature engineering approach to see if this potential \"underfitting\" could be resolved with additional features (see point below on weather).\n- The weather data was extremely complex and quite messy. We had to make a number of decisions along the way to get the model working. Our intent had been to get a base level of weather data incorporated, then circle back and add more. We only had time to add in snow data during that second pass.\n- We would have liked to further refine our outcome model. While signaling to a customer than an adverse effect is likely is a good thing, there remains a large gap in outcomes between a 16 minute delay and a four hour delay (or diverted flight!). Given more time, we would have liked to try to refine that outcome prediction with an additional model.\n\nIn terms of scalability, some of our most significant learnings include:\n - The use of the MLLib API abstracts away much of the thought (and frustration!) we experienced during the course working with RDDs. Indeed, in the rare occasions during this project where we considered utilising RDDs, out of memory errors quickly refocused us on finding solutions within the Dataframe API.\n - There remained a couple of instances, namely in creating and training our bagged models and in training the logistic regression ensembles, where we did not take advantage of the distributed environment. Given more time, we might have realized performance gains by parallelizing those computations, rather than iterating through them."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load savaed model metrics from CSV\n\nmetrics_df = pd.read_csv(\"/dbfs/user/ammara.essa@ischool.berkeley.edu/W261_Final_Project/predictions_df.csv\")\nmetrics_df.set_index('Unnamed: 0', inplace=True)\nmetrics_df.rename(index={'Unnamed: 0' : 'Model Name'}, inplace=True)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":110},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 6.1 Confusion Matrix for Test Data  \nBelow is the confusion matrix for predictions on the unseen test data.

After producing a 'predictions' dataframe with each row representing a prediction for our dev/test set, we would attempt to use sql queries to count the number of true/false positives and true/false negatives. It was a revelation to us that without caching, the sql queries would produce slightly different numbers from each run, despite our expectation that this would be a static exercise. Caching our predictions dataframe resolvd this issue, and several other similar issues that arose during our efforts to compile results (during bagging, etc). <br>\n\nWorking with a dataset with 32 million observations and joining to the weather dataset of 600 million observations was a valuable exercise. I/O scaled very well in the Spark Databricks cluster. The speed at which Spark is able to read and write parquet files was astounding.  In addition, our only out-of-memory errors occurred when we switched back to Pandas for some EDA.  We were concerned with possible scaling problems joining to the weather data, but the Spark dataframe API handled left joins from airlines to weather in under 30 minutes clock time with no out-of-memory errors.  The basic MLLib classifiers all scaled well with this dataset, with Logistic Regression typically training in under 2 minutes and Decision trees in under 5 minutes.  Once we elaborated on the models, introducing bagging and boosting, we were at the mercy of cluster load, with some training times exceeding 2 hours.  But on the whole, all of the models scaled very well.\n\nWriting the bagging algorithm from scratch really helped us think through and understand the different ways that tree models can be adapted to balance the bias variance tradeoff. While we did not see large gains in our metrics of interest from doing so, implementing this algortithm helped us understand the ways that random forests create high variance trees that are then balanced out through averaging, and that this reduction in variance can be extended by bagging deep trees or deep forests. We thought a lot about model complexity and regularization in the context of the logistic regression models, as well. The gridsearch crossfold validation routines that we ran would sometimes return a \"regParam\" equal to 0, effectively telling us that a model with no regularization was the best choice. On some iterations, though, a small entry would be returned, as well as a \"elasticNetParam\" setting indicating that a regularization blending L1 and L2 was the best implementation.\n\nWe utilized MLLib's pipeline API for one-hot encoding, standardization, and vector embedding.  In particular, the vector embedding made troubleshooting more challenging as the feature names were obscured.  However; we were able to obtain coefficients for the features in the Logistic Regression model to evaluate the odds ratios for the features and we were able to obtain the feature importance scores from the tree-based models.  Because the airlines dataset has a large number of observations, feature selection did not play a dominant role; however, there are still open questions regarding the appropriateness of one-hot encoding destination and arrival airports given such high cardinality. As such, we expected the tree-based models to perform better since categorical data converted to ordinals is well-tolerated by these models. Indeed, it was a bit of a disappointment to not see much improvement with recall scores, even with bagging and boosting.  \n\nAssumptions underlying different algorithms played an important role in our determination of our model choice and subsequently feature engineering efforts. For example, multicollinearity reduces the precision of the estimated weights in our logistic regression model which means we need to place special efforts to remove some features which are highly correlated to other features included in our model. However, a decision tree's ability to utilise highly correlated features effectively and even model interactions between features by the very nature of the structure of trees meant that far less care was required in determining which features to include and exclude.  Due to time limitations, we were not able to fully explore the limits of tree-based models ability to optimize predictions given our set of features - the fact that our ensembled trees utilitisng bagging, random forest and gradient-boosted trees did not result in notably improved performance over our standard decision tree works against our intuition and brings suspect to our feature engineering efforts."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## References"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Etani, Noriko (2019). \"Development of a predictive model for on‑time arrival flight of airliner by discovering correlation between flight and weather data.\" Journal of Big Data, 6:85.\n\nJames, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2017). \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning,\" Springer, chapters 4, 5, 6, and 8.\n\nKafle, Nabin, and Bo Zou (2016). “Modeling Flight Delay Propagation: A New Analytical-Econometric Approach.” Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, Pergamon, 1 Sept. 2016, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515302010.\n\nParr, Terence and Howard, Jeremy (2020). \"How to explain gradient boosting.\" Accessed in 2020: https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html.\n\nPatgiri, Ripon, Sajid Hussain and Aditya Nongmeikapam (2020). \"Empirical Study on Airline Delay Analysis and Prediction.\"\" arXiv.
