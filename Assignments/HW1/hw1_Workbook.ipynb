    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

Using the text: *\"Alice had an adventure that took alice to wonderland\"*, give a concrete example of how two different tokenizers could cause us to get two different results on this calculation.

For example, if case is ignored, 'alice' will be counted twice, but if case is considered, 'Alice' and 'alice will be counted separately.  Also, if the tokenizer considers certain stop words like 'an','that' and 'to', this will lower the number of unique words.  In general, the more unique words that are counted in the corpus, the lower the estimated liklihood of a word given a class.\n",

If the current word matches the look-ahead token, we have found the plural form.  Combine the word counts for the current word and the plural form and zero out the word count for the plural form.  Since we only need to iterate through the words once, this is $O(n)$ complexity.  \n",

    "What would happen if we tried to run our script on a much larger dataset? For one thing, it would take longer to run. However there is a second concern. The Python object that aggregates our counts (`defaultdict`) exists in memory on the machine running this notebook. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. The solution? Divide and Conquer! Instead of running the script on the whole dataset at once, we could split our text up in to smaller 'chunks' and process them independently of each other. __In this question you'll use a bash script to \"parallelize\" your Word Count.__\n",

    "# Question 7: Parallel Word Count (part 2)\n",
    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simiulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What is the potential scalability problem with the provided implementation of `aggregateCounts_v1.py`? Explain why this supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count wouldn't work on a really large input corpus.  [`HINT:` _see the intro to Q6_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code:__ Fortunately, a 'strategic sort' can solve this problem. Read the instructions at the top of `pWordCount_v2.sh` carefully then make your changes that alphabetically sort the output from the mappers (`countfiles`) before piping them into the reducer script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."

    "> __a)__ The mapper and reducer tasks both rely on defaultdict to count words, which will require all unique words (and their counts) to remain in-memory until the tasks completes.  If the corpus is very large, this may exceed the memory of the machine. \n",

Also, our current scripts don't account for failure, so if there is an error in one of the mapper tasks, the bash script will not complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Sort each output file from each mapper task.  Then we merge the sorted files and split the data such that no key is split across different partitions.  Since the data is sorted, we can split the chunks into equal partitions and then adjust the split point so that it occurs when the keys are different."

    "In your reading for Week 1's live session, [Chapter1, section 2](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/MapReduce-book-final.pdf) of _Data Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce_, Lin and Dyer discuss a number of \"Big Ideas\" that underlie large scale processing: __scale \"out,\" not \"up\"; assume failures are common; move processing to the data; process data sequentially and avoid random access; hide system-level details from the application developer; and seamless scalability.__ Part of our work this semester will be to interact with these ideas in a practical way, not just a conceptual one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What do Lin and Dyer consider the two features of an \"ideal algorithm\" from a scalability perspective?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ The mapper script below (created on the fly using a little Jupyter magic) will help us illustrate the concept of scalability. Run the provided code which passes this mapper script to our parallel computation 'framework' and runs the 'analysis' on the _Alice_ text file. Note that we've omitted a reducer for simplicity. What do you observe about the time it takes to run this \"algorithm\" when we use 1, 2 and 4 partitions? Does it meet Lin and Dyer's criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Let's try something similar with your Word Count analysis. Run the provided code to time your implementation with 1, 2, 4 and 8 partitions. What do you observe about the runtimes? Does this match your expectation? Speculate about why we might be seeing these times. What conclusions should we draw about the scalability of our implementation? [`HINT:` _consider the limitations of both your machine and our implementation... there are some competing forces at work, what are they?_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) OPTIONAL:__ Which components of your Map-Reduce algorithm are affected by a change in the number of partitions? Does increasing the number of partitions increase or decrease the total time spent on each of these portions of the task? What tradeoff does this cause?"

    "### Q8 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ An ideal algorithm will scale such that if the data is halfed, the algorithm should run in half the time or better.  If the task is split into 2 tasks, it should run in half the time or better.  So we would see the algorithm increase linearly with more data and decrease linearly as the tasks are split into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Yes, this mapper script runs in about half the time (~.53) as we subdivide the tasks.  We see this same decrease as we continue to divide from 2 to 4 partitions, so it is continuing to scale linearly, meeting the Lin Dyer's criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ We only see a small decrease in the time when we half the data into 2 partitions.  Then from 2 to 4 partitions, we see a slight increase into execution time and another slight increase from 4 to 8 partitions.  Then we see a more significant degradation at 8 and 16 partitions.  Using our mapper code, we do not see the metrics of an \"ideal\" scalable algorithm.  Every time we increase the number of parallel tasks, we must use compute resources to keep tracks of these tasks.  So ideally, we would need that extra time devoted to this housekeeping to be idle time on the computer so that we are not taking resources away from the mapper tasks.  The first \"dummy\" mapper had a sleep time for each iteration, essentially freeing the computer to perform the housekeeping and ensuring that none of the parallel mapper tasks were competing for resources.\n",

    "> __a)__ Word counting is an embarassingly parallel problem because there is no shared state between mapper tasks nor reducer tasks; all can operate independently.  For word counting the 'task' is to count the number of unique word occurrences.  The implementation of that task will vary, both in terms of how the code is written to perform the counting and what parameters are used to parallelize the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ A task is associative if the data can be grouped differently and the results are always the same.  For example, the associate property of addition stats that $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.  The task is commutative if the data can be ordered differently and always produce the same results. For example, the commutative property of addition states that $a + b = b + a$.  We need the map and reduce operations to be both associative and commutative for an embarrassingly parallel problem so that grouping and ordering of the data don't matter, allowing each task to run independently without the need for any communication between the tasks."
